CodeCademy Climate Change
====

This is a SQL data analysis project for the the 'Analyze Data with SQL' skill path by [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/paths/analyze-data-with-sql).
The goal of this project is to demonstrate proficieny in the following:
  1.  AVG as a window function
  2.  FIRST_VALUE / LAST_VALUE
  3.  LAG / LEAD
  4.  RANK
  5.  NTILE
   
   Included in this repository:
   1. This README.md
   2. The SQL queries climate_change.sql
   3. The analysis page climate_change.md

The query results are about 6000 results per query and of less focus for this project. Therefore I will only include the first ten results each to show the query worked correctly
